    <h3>A lovely, crispy waffle perfect for the morning</h3>
    <p>
        Easy and delicious homemade waffles, that are one bowl and a spoon easy to make and are made with simple pantry staples. 
        These waffles are crispy on the outside and fluffy and flavourful on the inside. 
        My idea of perfect!

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <p>
           <ul>
              <li>1 3/4 cup all purpose flour</li> 
              <li>2 teaspoon baking powder</li> 
              <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li> 
              <li>1 Tablespoon white sugar</li> 
              <li>3 large eggs</li> 
              <li>7 Tablespoons vegetable oil, <em>other neutral tasting liquid oil</em></li> 
              <li>1 1/2 cups milk, <em>or buttermilk</em></li> 
           </ul> 
           <p>
            <h4>Steps</h4>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat your waffle iron before starting to mix your batter.</li>
                    <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, 
                        salt and sugar. Make a well in the middle. 
                        Break the eggs into the well and beat lightly with a fork. 
                        Add the oil and milk and stir until moistened 
                        (Some lumps are ok. Doesn't need to be smooth. Just moistened.)</li>
                    <li>I like to spray my waffle iron with cooking spray right before adding the batter. 
                        Your waffle maker may or may not need that step.</li>
                    <li>Spoon batter into hot waffle iron and cook until golden and crispy.</li>
                    <li>Serve warm, with butter and maple syrup.</li>
                </ol>
